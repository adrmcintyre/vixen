Need to rework how branches work, as the max branch target
is far too small, and doing a direct jump is painful, e.g.

        blcs .far
.cont   ...
        ...
.far    ...

needs to become something like:

        blcs .stub
        bra .cont
.stub   ldw pc, [pc]
        dw .far
.cont   ...
        ...
.far    ...

How about doing away with all bCC instructions and replacing with skipCC.
This frees up 4 bits in the old bCC instruction space, getting us 12 bits of
branch target instead of 8, which is +-4096 bytes, since jumps are aligned.
