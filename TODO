video:
    fix any off-by-one errors in the video output

clock:
    Right now we're running everything off the ECP5's external 25MHz clock.
    Should try using the PLL to generate a faster internal clock, just as
    we're already doing for the video.

asm.pl:
    * Implement textual macros
        * Where could they appear?
        * Easiest: anywhere an instruction can.
        * Pure textual substitution (with args)
        * Could just fall back on cpp preprocessor.
        * Example:
            macro add3(x, y, z)
                mov x, y
                add x, z
            endmacro
            ...

            add3 r1, r2, r3
