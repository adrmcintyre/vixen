asm.pl:
    * At each step of evaluation, values are &ed with value_mask.
    Figure out if this is the best strategy.  Ideally we'd probably
    have arbitrary precision signed binary.

    * Implement textual macros
        * Where could they appear?
        * Easiest: anywhere an instruction can.
        * Pure textual substitution (with args)
        * Could just fall back on cpp preprocessor.
        * Example:
            macro add3(x, y, z)
                mov x, y
                add x, z
            endmacro
            ...

            add3 r1, r2, r3

    * Implement register aliases, e.g.:
        alias pc r15
        alias link r14
